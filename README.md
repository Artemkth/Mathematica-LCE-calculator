Short script calculating Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents for arbitrary-dimension ODE with differentiable forces

Algorithm is updated version of the one mentioned in https://venturi.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/Numerical_Calculation_of_Lyapunov_Exponents.pdf; new features are used to simplify the program, while un-normalized Gram-Shmidt orthogonalization is reimplemented because it has been since removed from standard utilities.
